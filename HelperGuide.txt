1. Enter mod.json and add the name of your mod to the name section
(im assuming you have visual studio code and know C#)
2.Add the picture you want as the icon of your mod and rename it to icon.png
3.Rename the name space in Traits.cs to whatever you want, then put that same name in the namespace in main.cs
4. Add your own traits and enjoy!
5. Dont forget to add PlayerConfig.unlockTrait("Trait Name"); add the end of your trait code
6. Dont forget to remove this when you're done
7. All the baseStats are health, damage, intelligence, stewardship, warfare, diplomacy, range, attackSpeed, all of these baseStats only need a =
8. Armor needs a + before the =
9. Speed,scale need a + before the = and an f after the numbers for your baseStats
10.knockbackReduction,inherit, areaOfEffect, and birth need an f after the numbers for your baseStats
11. birth and inherit are not baseStats so they would be Trait name.birth = 100f;

1.Im assuming its been a couple days since you have made your mod, to make your mod less... shit sorry not sorry ill show you how to add custom icons
2.Make a GameResources folder
3.Inside the GameResources folder make an ui folder
4.Inside the ui folder you make an Icons folder
5.Now you can add the transparent png into your Icons folder for example "God.png"
6.Inside your icon code write is as "ui/Icons/God"
7.Dont forget to remove this when you're done
8.Now you can enjoy custom icons!

                                Special Effects / Death Effects (1/2)

1. You have most likely seen trait mods like trait bonanza, traitbox, and super traits and have wondered how do they make the traits do special things.
2. You're gonna make another line of code, heres an example "Trait Name.action_death = new WorldAction(ActionLibrary.castTornado);
3. What that code did is that whenver when someone with that trait dies it summons a tornado
4. You can edit that code with other special effects in the game
5. To check all the actions use dnspy and check Assembly-CSharp and click the option that has {-}
6. After you click - look for ActionLibrary
7. Now you have learned all the 3 basic elements of trait mods now go make your mod from half-ass to 3 quarter ass
8. Dont forget to remove this when you're done

                                Special Effects / Death Effects (2/2)
1.Wow your done well now part 2 is out
2. you will add a line of code called trait name.action_special_effect = (WorldAction)Delegate.Combine(Trait name.action_special_effect, new WorldAction(Whatever));
3. now go to the bottom of traits.cs and you will find a build that looks likes the example of below

                        }
                        }
}
4. If you want to make a system so that it adds giant trait if they have slow trait then you will make it look like this

                        }
                        public static bool Whatever you put in the action effect code(BaseSimObject pTarget, WorldTile pTile = null)
				}
                        	Actor a = Reflection.GetField(pTarget.GetType(), pTarget, "a") as Actor;
                              a.addTrait("giant")
                              return true;
                        }

                        }
}
5. Ummm well i guess this is it i mean goodbye i hope you make good mods
